1.Difference between HTTP1.1 VS HTTP2
Ans.
HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 are different versions of the hyper text transfer protocol used to transfering data over the web.
HTT1.1:
1.HTTP1.1 relies on single connection per request.
2.It uses a text based protocol,which is human readable but less efficient formachines process.
3.It does not compress headers,and each request includes significant amount of redundant data.
HTTP2:
1.HTTP2 introduced multiplexing ,where multiple requests can be sent and received on a single connection simunltaneously.
2.this allows for more efficient and faster comunication between the clent and server
3.It uses binary protocol,which is more compact and easier to prase and improved performance.
4.It inclueds header compresion which reduces the size of the headers.
5.HTTP2 introduce a feature caled server push.
6.HTTP2 Allows prioritization of requests.




2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Ans.
1.Objects are collections of key value pairs
2.Each value can be of any data type including other objects ,functions,or arrays.
3.objects can be created using object literals,constructors,es6 classes
4.we can add a new property or remove a property while during the execution.
Internal representation in Javascript:
1.internal representation of object is based on "Hash table" .
2.Each object property is internally stored   as a key value pair in a hash table
3.Enuarating object properties  we have various methods like object keys,for in loop,object.values () using these methods we can iterate over the object properties.
